		<h2>A resume</h2>
		<p>First things first, a little bit about me:</p>
		<br>
		<p>My dad was a nerd in the 80's, so coding helps me feel closer to him. Unfortunately, it seems like everyone in a class at BYU already has prior experience and I am losing my mind trying to keep up. I wish these classes were designed more for people like me, trying to start to learn something rather than continue on something I've already begun to learn</p>
		<br>

			<li>An HTML resume I built a while back</li>
			<li>A Direct vs. Hohmman Time trajectory calculator</li>
