				<p>My name is DJ Sproul and my father was a geek in the 1980s. From a young age, he always fascinated me with all the things he knew how to do on a computer. I never understood any of it and it seemed like something I could never attain, so I never tried to follow in his footsteps.</p>
				<br>
				<p>I can't tell exactly when that changed, but at some point during my first semester at Brigham Young University (notably as a linguistics major) while I was bored at work, I remembered my dad had shown me how to edit the html in a browser. In fact, as I write this letter I distinctly remember removing all of the html in a new tab and typing "Website" in the head tag. I wondered why it didn't change anything in my browser window but the name of the tab.</p>
				<br>	
				<p>Even though I didn't understand it and even though it didn't do what I wanted it to, I was so intrigued by that head tag that I downloaded Google's Grasshopper app, Mimo, Programming Hub, and VS Code (the editor I wrote this website with) within about a week. I completed them soon after and changed my major to computer science with an emphasis in software engineering.</p>
				<br>
				<p>It hasn't been my dream for very long, but I have finally found the thing in life that I am passionate about. I have a vision for my career, something that eluded me for twenty long years. That is why I am applying for this position.</p>
