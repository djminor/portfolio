                    <p>Recently, I built a personal digital assistant to run on my computer and help me with everyday tasks. I built it in Python and while it is far from finished, I have already started using it more than Cortana for my personal needs. To build it, I downloaded/imported quite a few libraries, as you'd imagine, the major two of which are speech_recognition and pyttsx3.</p>

                    <p>For two years, I served as a missionary for my church. I did 16 hours of unpaid work every day, teaching people about my beliefs and serving the community where I could. I attribute many of my skills to this.</p>

                    <p>This project isn't finished, but it's one that I founded myself. The vision is to create a language-learning app one day that focuses on bringing endangered languages back and preserving them for posterity. I had the idea because my wife is a member of the Ponca Tribe of Nebraska, one of the smallest indigenous tribes in the US. Fewer than 50 people speak the tribe's language fluently. I wanted my wife to have the chance to learn it, so I tracked down a difficult to find dictionary. She was so happy when I gave it to her that I just wanted to bring that joy to other people.</p>
